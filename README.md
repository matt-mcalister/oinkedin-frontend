# oinkedIn

## What is this?

oinkedIn is the first– and hopefully, the last– pig-based social networking web app. This repo is for the frontend (react), to see the backend (rails), [click here](https://github.com/matt-mcalister/oinkedin-backend).

## Usage Tips

The home page of oinkedIn welcomes the user with a warm "Welcome, Y'Oinker!" (do not be offended, as 'Oinker' is a term of endearment in the community).
Enter your name to log in, but be careful – anyone who logs in as 'David', for example, will be using the same pig.

In the lobby there are three main choices:
  * The Hogwash
  * Join a PigPen
  * Create a PigPen

#### The Hogwash

In the Hogwash you are able to customize your pig– click on a color in the top row to change color, select a body type, or grease up your pig.

If you are displeased with the decisions you've made and miss your old pig, simply click 'Revert Pig' and your pig will return to it's beautiful old self.

If you're satisfied, hit 'Save Pig' and all of your changes will be maintained.

#### Join a PigPen

PigPens are the place to hang out in oinked in. Each features a title, a brief description of what users are there for, and a count of how many pigs are currently hanging out.

#### Create a PigPen

If you don't see a PigPen that fits your interests, you can create your own. Upon creation you will join the PigPen where you can await more like-minded pigs.

#### PigPens

Once in the PigPen you can walk around with the arrow keys, or if you want to send a message just start typing and hit enter to send.

Happy Oinking!
